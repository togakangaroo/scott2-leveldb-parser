This is a simple data parser app for working with [http://scott.dada.pink/](http://scott.dada.pink/)

# The problem

Although scott.dada is fine for entering data, viewing summaries, and viewing info on one record at a time, it falls down when trying to view a bunch of records at once. It allows the option to export to csv, but the exports are huge, have many line breaks in cells, and generally cannot be opened by spreadsheet programs.

# The solution

This is a very simple app to take a database dump, and put a front-end on it that will allow the data to be projected and filtered in several useful ways to actually get it to open in a spreadsheet.
